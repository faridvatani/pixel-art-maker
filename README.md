# Pixel Art Maker

<img src="Screenshot.png" alt="pixel art maker" />

A simple pixel art maker built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Users can create pixel art by clicking on cells in a grid and selecting a color. The grid size can be adjusted, and users can choose from a color palette or input a custom color. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- Interactive Grid: A grid of cells that can be clicked to change their color.
- Dynamic Grid Size: Users can select the size of the grid.
- Color Selection: Users can choose a color from a color input or a predefined color palette.
- Reset Functionality: Users can reset the grid to its default state.
- Real-time Updates: The grid updates in real-time as users interact with it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
